# Team Dashboard Frontend (React + JWT)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is the frontend React application for the **Team Task Manager** project. It acts as a headless dashboard to manage teams and tasks, communicating with a WordPress backend that uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication.

The app supports role-based access, giving Admins full control and Team Members limited view access.

## ⚠️ Important: Installing Dependencies

When you first set up this project, **please install node modules using this command** to avoid peer dependency conflicts (especially with React 19):

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This ensures smooth installation and avoids errors related to package version conflicts.

## 🌐 API Base URLs

Make sure to update the API URLs to match your environment.

**Default examples:**

- Base API: `http://team-dashboard-project.local/wp-json/teamtask/v1`
- JWT Login: `http://team-dashboard-project.local/wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/token`

👉 Replace `http://team-dashboard-project.local/` with your local or live WordPress site URL in `axios.jsx`.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Build a responsive task management frontend using React 19 (Vite)
- Allow login via WordPress JWT authentication
- Support protected routes based on user roles (Admin, Team Member)
- Enable Admins to manage teams, tasks, and assignments
- Allow Team Members to view their assigned tasks only

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 (Vite)
- **Authentication**: JWT (token stored in localStorage)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM v7
- **UI Components**: Plain React (optional Bootstrap integration)
- **Backend**: WordPress exposing custom REST API + JWT plugin

## 👥 Role-Based Access

| Role          | Access                                           |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Administrator | Full dashboard: manage teams, tasks, assignments |
| Team Member   | Limited to viewing only assigned tasks           |

## 🧱 Folder Structure

```
src/
├── api/             # Axios instance + auth functions
├── components/      # Sidebar, TeamList, TaskList, Forms
├── pages/           # Login, AdminDashboard, TeamDashboard
├── router/          # AppRoutes.jsx (handles route setup)
├── App.jsx          # Main app (user state + routing)
├── main.jsx         # Entry point with <BrowserRouter>
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User logs in with WordPress credentials  
2. `/jwt-auth/v1/token` returns JWT token  
3. Token is stored in localStorage  
4. `/wp/v2/users/me` fetches current user info including role  
5. Routes render conditionally based on user role
